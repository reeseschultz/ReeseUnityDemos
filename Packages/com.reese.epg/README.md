# Reese's Entity Prefab Groups

Create and reference groups of entity prefabs with ease.

## Import

This package depends on Chris Foulston's [Reorderable List](https://github.com/cfoulston/Unity-Reorderable-List).

First, import that dependency by copying one of the below Git URLs:

* **HTTPS:** `https://github.com/cfoulston/Unity-Reorderable-List.git#ac1f508240fb752b1f9d7c222c231d7f2a33df87`
* **SSH:** `git@github.com:cfoulston/Unity-Reorderable-List.git#ac1f508240fb752b1f9d7c222c231d7f2a33df87`

Then go to `Window â‡’ Package Manager` in the editor. Press the `+` symbol in the top-left corner, and then click on `Add package from git URL`. Paste the text you copied and finally click `Add`.

Next, do the same for one of the Git URLs corresponding to *this* package:

* **HTTPS:** `https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos.git#epg`
* **SSH:** `git@github.com:reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos.git#epg`

Would you like the import process to be simpler? The maintainer of this package certainly would. Consider asking Unity to support Git URLs in package manifests [here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/custom-package-with-git-dependencies.628390/).
