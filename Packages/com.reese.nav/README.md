# Reese's DOTS Navigation

![Video of navigation agents jumping across moving surfaces.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/master/Gifs/nav-moving-jump-demo.gif)

## Introduction

Here are the design highlights of this navigation package:

1. **Multi-threading** support.
1. **Obstacle avoidance** support.
1. **Terrain** support.
1. Support for **auto-jumping** of agents between [NavMeshSurfaces](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/ThirdParty/NavMeshComponents/Scripts/NavMeshSurface.cs).
1. Support for **artificial gravity** relative to an agent's current surface.
1. Support for **complex parenting of surfaces** to so-called *bases*, uninformly updating child transforms as a group.
1. Support for **parenting agents to surfaces** so that agents may navigate across surfaces moving independently of one another.
1. **UPM** support via Git and [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/).
1. **Included demo scenes** in [Assets/Scenes/Nav](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/tree/master/Assets/Scenes/Nav).
1. **Extensive documentation** 

I care more about usability than performance. The navigation code should be reasonably easy to use and work as expected. Performance is highly important, just not as much as delivering the jumping and parenting features.

Want to know more about why and how I designed this package? Read [this blog post](https://reeseschultz.com/dots-navigation-with-auto-jumping-agents-and-movable-surfaces/).

## Prerequisites

First, familiarize yourself with [Unity DOTS](https://unity.com/dots).

Second, you may want to *clone* the containing demo project since it has glue code not part of `Reese.Nav`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos.git
```

If you do clone the project, the files you might want fall under:

* [Assets/Scripts/Nav](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/Nav) - These are helpful, especially the [NavFallSystem](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Nav/NavFallSystem.cs) since how you want to handle falling is entirely up to you—it's not part of the core navigation code because it's too dependent on the game or simulation in question.
* [Assets/Scenes/Nav](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/tree/master/Assets/Scenes/Nav) - The home of the nav demo scenes. It's easier to modify these than start from scratch—take it from me.

Third, open the project with the intended Unity editor version. I recommend using [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) to manage various editor versions. Play around.

## Import

There are two ways to import this package into *your* Unity project, one being with [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/), the preferred method, and the other via Git URL.

### OpenUPM

This requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `12` or greater. Just `cd` to your project's directory and run:

```sh
npx openupm-cli add com.reese.nav
```

### Git

This requires Unity editor `2019.3` or greater. Copy one of the below Git URLs:

* **HTTPS:** `https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos.git#nav`
* **SSH:** `git@github.com:reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos.git#nav`

Then go to `Window ⇒ Package Manager` in the editor. Press the `+` symbol in the top-left corner, and then click on `Add package from git URL`. Paste the text you copied and finally click `Add`.

## Usage

So how's this thing work? The navigation systems process entities with **three key components**:

1. [NavAgent](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Agent/NavAgent.cs) - A component added to any entity you want to, well, navigate.
2. [NavSurface](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Surface/NavSurface.cs) - A component added to [GameObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) during authoring that also have the [NavMeshSurface](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/ThirdParty/NavMeshComponents/Scripts/NavMeshSurface.cs) attached. Make sure you bake your surfaces!
3. [NavBasis](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Basis/NavBasis.cs) - A glorified parent transform you may attach to any arbitrary [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html). If you don't assign your surfaces to a basis, then they will be parented to a shared default basis.

### 1. The [NavAgent](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Agent/NavAgent.cs)

No effort was made attempting parity between Unity's concept of the [NavMeshAgent](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/AI.NavMeshAgent.html) and this one—in fact, it's expected that you do *not* use the aforementioned component.

#### Initialization Variables

The [NavAgent](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Agent/NavAgent.cs) has a multitude of member variables. We're mainly concerned with the user-facing variables. Lets start with initialization-related ones (these should be set while spawning agents):

* `JumpDegrees`: `float` - It's the jump angle in degrees. `45` is a reasonable value to try.
* `JumpGravity`: `float` - It's artifical gravity used specifically for the projectile motion calculations during jumping. `200` is a reasonable value to try.
* `JumpSpeedMultiplierX`: `float` - The jump speed along the horizontal axis. `1.5f` is a reasonable value to try.
* `JumpSpeedMultiplierY`: `float` - The jump speed along the vertical axis. `2` is a reasonable value to try.
* `TranslationSpeed`: `float` - This is the translation (movement) speed of the agent. `20` is a reasonable value to try.
* `RotationSpeed`: `float` - This is the rotation (movement) speed of the agent. `0.3f` is a reasonable value to try.
* `TypeID`: `int` - This is the type of agent, in terms of the NavMesh system. See examples of use in the demo spawners. There is also a helper method for setting the type from a `string` in the [NavUtil](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/NavUtil.cs) called `GetAgentType`.
* `Offset`: `float3` - This is the offset of the agent from the basis. It's a `float3` and not a mere float representing the y-component from the surface, which you may find odd. But the idea here is to provide flexibility. While you may usually only set the y-component, there could be situations where you want to set x or z.

See the [demo spawners](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/Nav/Spawner) for examples of usage.

#### Status Variables & Components

Here are the internally-managed component tags (defined in [NavAgentStatus](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Agent/NavAgentStatus.cs)) that are applied to [NavAgents](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Agent/NavAgent.cs) throughout the navigation lifecycle. Do *not* write to these, just use them for querying:

* `NavFalling` - Exists if the agent is falling.
* `NavHasProblem` - Exists if the agent has a problematic [PathQueryStatus](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Experimental.AI.PathQueryStatus.html) preventing further path planning. The navigation package will not process agents with this component. You need to handle and remove the component as needed. Problems tend to arise to due incorrect values set in `NavConstants`, which is discussed later in this guide.
* `NavJumping` - Exists if the agent is jumping.
* `NavLerping` - Exists if the agent is lerping.
* `NavNeedsSurface` - Exists if the agent needs a surface. This component should be added when spawning an agent. It's also automatically added after the agent jumps. When this component exists, the [NavSurfaceSystem](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Surface/NavSurfaceSystem.cs) will try to raycast for a new surface potentially underneath said agent.
* `NavPlanning` - Exists if the agent is planning paths or jumps.

Finally, you should write to the following component:

* `NavNeedsDestination` - Exists if the agent needs a destination. In this `struct`, there's a self-explanatory `float3` named `Destination`. There's also an optional `bool` named `Teleport`, which toggles teleportation to the provided `Destination`.

You may *optionally* add another component to your agents when spawning, by the way:

* `NavTerrainCapable` - Only needed if your agents must navigate on terrain. Don't use it otherwise, since it may negatively impact performance.

See the [demo destination systems](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/Nav/Destination) for examples of usage.

### 2. The [NavSurface](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Surface/NavSurface.cs)

The [NavSurface](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Surface/NavSurface.cs) is much less complicated than the [NavAgent](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Agent/NavAgent.cs). What you'll mainly be concerned with is the associated [NavSurfaceAuthoring](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Surface/NavSurfaceAuthoring.cs) script. It has some important public variables:

* `HasGameObjectTransform`: `bool` - **Optional, but false if not manually set.** If true the GameObject's transform will be used and applied to possible children via [CopyTransformFromGameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.11/api/Unity.Transforms.CopyTransformFromGameObject.html?q=copytransform). If false the entity's transform will be used and applied conversely via [CopyTransformToGameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.11/api/Unity.Transforms.CopyTransformToGameObject.html).
* `JumpableSurfaces`: `List<NavSurfaceAuthoring>` - **Optional.** This is a list of surfaces that are "jumpable" from *this* one. Automating what's "jumpable" is out of scope for this package, but automating jumping itself is not; thus, by using an agent-associated `parent.Value` and checking its [NavJumpableBufferElement](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Surface/NavJumpableBufferElement.cs) buffer, you can write code to deliberate on which surface to jump to. The [NavPointAndClickDestinationSystem](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Nav/Destination/NavPointAndClickDestinationSystem.cs) already does this for demonstrational purposes.
* `Basis`: `NavBasisAuthoring` - **Optional.** This is the basis for a given surface. Surfaces that parented to the same basis can be transformed together by said basis.

Other than that, you may have some reason to query [NavSurfaces](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/tree/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Surface), but that's about it.

### 3. The [NavBasis](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Basis/NavBasis.cs)

This is our last component to cover. Whew. It's simple, really. Like the [NavSurface](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Surface/NavSurface.cs), you only need to know about the related [NavBasisAuthoring](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Basis/NavBasisAuthoring.cs) script. It has a couple public variables:

* `HasGameObjectTransform`: `bool` - Same deal as the [NavSurface](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Surface/NavSurface.cs).
* `ParentBasis`: `NavBasisAuthoring` - In essence, a basis can have a basis.

What is the basis, exactly? It's abstract for a reason: it's a glorified parent transform. The logic is as follows: a basis can be the child of a basis; a surface can be a child of a basis; and finally, an agent can be a child of a surface. And as previously stated, the basis is optional. You don't have to set it on a [NavSurfaceAuthoring](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Basis/NavBasisAuthoring.cs) script; a default basis will be created for you.

### Layers

All [GameObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) with [NavSurfaces](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Surface/NavSurface.cs) should be set to layer 28. All obstacles should be set to layer 29. Otherwise, things won't work because the nav package depends on ray and collider casting. For more information on the layers and overriding them, see the section on constants below.

### Constants

There are many constants in [NavConstants](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/NavConstants.cs). Constants corresponding to the layers are as follows (feel free to change them if needed):

* `SURFACE_LAYER`: `int` - Default is `28`.
* `OBSTACLE_LAYER`: `int` - Default is `29`.
* `COLLIDER_LAYER`: `int` - Default is `30`.

The nav package handles bit masking so you don't have to.

Additionally, there are other user-facing constants you may need to change:

* `DESTINATION_SURFACE_COLLIDER_RADIUS`: `float` - Default is `1`. A sphere collider of the specified radius is used to detect the destination surface.
* `JUMP_SECONDS_MAX`: `float` - Default is `5`. Upper limit on the *duration* spent jumping before the agent is actually considered falling. This limit can be reached when the agent tries to jump too close to the edge of a surface and misses.
* `OBSTACLE_RAYCAST_DISTANCE_MAX`: `float` - Default is `100`. Upper limit on the raycast distance when searching for an obstacle in front of a given NavAgent.
* `SURFACE_RAYCAST_DISTANCE_MAX`: `float` - Default is `100`. Upper limit on the raycast distance when searching for a surface below a given [NavAgent](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Agent/NavAgent.cs).
* `ITERATION_MAX`: `int` - Upper limit on the iterations performed in a [NavMeshQuery](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Experimental.AI.NavMeshQuery.html) to find a path in the [NavPlanSystem](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Agent/NavPlanSystem.cs).
* `JUMPABLE_SURFACE_MAX`: `int` - Default is `30`. Upper limit on a given jumpable surface buffer. Exceeding this will only result in heap memory blocks being allocated.
* `PATH_NODE_MAX`: `int` - Default is `1000`. Upper limit on a given path buffer. Exceeding this only result in heap memory blocks being allocated.
* `PATH_SEARCH_MAX` - Default is `1000`. Upper limit on the search area size during path planning.
* `SURFACE_RAYCAST_MAX` - Default is `100`. Upper limit on the number of raycasts to attempt in searching for a surface below the NavAgent. Exceeding this implies that there is no surface below the agent, its then determined to be falling which means that no more raycasts will be performed.

## Conclusion

That's it. The navigation code is subject to change at any time, and if it does, it's to help, not confuse you. I'll keep the guide updated to ensure it's current and hopefully understandable. If you have any improvements or suggestions, feel free open an issue and/or submit a PR.

## Tips

* Make sure you bake your [NavMeshSurfaces](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/ThirdParty/NavMeshComponents/Scripts/NavMeshSurface.cs)!
* Anything with an authoring script on it also needs an accompanying [ConvertToEntity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.11/api/Unity.Entities.ConvertToEntity.html?q=convert%20to%20ent) script as well. Don't forget! The Unity Editor should warn you about that.
* The compatible version of [NavMeshComponents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents) is *already* in [Packages/com.reese.nav/ThirdParty](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/tree/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/ThirdParty/)! Use that and nothing else, and I mean for your entire project. Do not try to mix and match it with other versions.
* Upon spawning [NavAgents](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/Agent/NavAgent.cs), ensure you have their initial [Translation.Value](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.11/api/Unity.Transforms.Translation.html?q=translation) right, along with their `Offset`. Getting these things wrong may result in your agents being unable to raycast the surface below them, since they may be raycasting underneath it!
* Obstacles need the [NavMeshObstacle](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/class-NavMeshObstacle.html), colliders, and the [ConvertToEntity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.11/api/Unity.Entities.ConvertToEntity.html?q=convert%20to%20ent) script on them. Otherwise obstacles will not be detected by raycasts. By the way, `Carve` should be `true`.
