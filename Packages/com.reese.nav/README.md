## Introduction

This is a multi-threaded navigation package using [Unity DOTS](https://unity.com/dots), maintained by [Reese](https://github.com/reeseschultz/). It supports obstacle avoidance, terrain, agents automatically jumping between surfaces with artificial gravity, parenting of agents and surfaces for preserving local transformations, flocking behaviors (originally contributed by [Dennis](https://github.com/0x6c23)) and even backward compatibility with GameObjects. 

If you don't want all the extra bells and whistles, such as surface management and jumping, please see the [pathing package](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/tree/path#reeses-dots-pathing) instead.

## Support

## Clone (Optional)

You may want to *clone* the containing [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) since it has demos and glue code not part of `Reese.Nav`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos.git
```

From the project, note, for instance, the [NavFallSystem](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Nav/NavFallSystem.cs) in `Assets/Scripts/Nav`, since how you want to handle falling is entirely up to you—it's not part of the core navigation code because it's too dependent on the game or simulation in question.

## Import

There are two ways to import this package into an existing Unity project, one being with [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/) and the other via Git URL.

### OpenUPM

This requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `12` or greater. Just `cd` to your project's directory and run:

```sh
npx openupm-cli add com.reese.nav
```

### Git

This requires Unity editor `2019.3` or greater. Copy one of the below Git URLs:

* **HTTPS:** `https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos.git#nav`
* **SSH:** `git@github.com:reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos.git#nav`

Then go to `Window ⇒ Package Manager` in the editor. Press the `+` symbol in the top-left corner, and then click on `Add package from git URL`. Paste the text you copied and finally click `Add`.

## Usage at a Glance

For this navigation package, whether you're using it with GameObjects or entities, there are three concepts to be familiar with:

1. **Agent** - An actor or character that navigates. The package automatically parents agents to surfaces.
2. **Surface** - A space for agents to navigate upon. Surfaces are parented to bases (if no explicit basis is provided, a default basis is used at the world origin).
3. **Basis** - A glorified parent transform that allows multiple surfaces to move as a whole.

### Authoring Components

1. `NavAgentAuthoring` - Converts GameObjects into entities with the `NavAgent` component, and other needed components.
2. `NavFlocking` - Optional component one may add to agents to achieve flocking.
3. `NavSurfaceAuthoring` - Converts GameObjects into entities with the `NavSurface` component, and other needed components.
4. `NavBasisAuthoring` - Converts GameObjects into entities with the `NavBasis` component, and other needed components.

### Usage with GameObjects

To retain navigating agents *as* GameObjects, rather than converting them into entities, add the `NavAgentHybrid` to them *instead* of `NavAgentAuthoring`. Such hybrid agents are still able to interact with other objects with `NavSurfaceAuthoring` and `NavBasisAuthoring` components, so long as as the Conversion Mode for them is set to "Convert and Inject Game Object." FYI, `NavAgentAuthoring` works by creating an invisible entity with the `NavAgent` component in the background. The `NavAgentHybrid` updates its GameObject transform to match that of the background entity.

### Entity Components

1. `NavAgent` - A component for making entities into agents.
2. `NavSurface` - A component for making entities into surfaces.
3. `NavBasis` - A component for making entities into bases.

#### Status Components & Variables

Here are the internally-managed components (defined in `NavAgentStatus`) that are applied to `NavAgent`s throughout the navigation lifecycle. Do **not** write to these, just query them to check existence:

| `IComponentData`      | Description                                                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`NavWalking`**      | Exists if the agent is walking.                                          |
| **`NavJumping`**      | Exists if the agent is jumping.                                          |
| **`NavFalling`**      | Exists if the agent is falling.                                          |
| **`NavPlanning`**     | Exists if the agent is planning.                                         |
| **`NavNeedsSurface`** | Exists if the agent needs a surface.                                     |
| **`NavSteering`**     | Holds the steering data for the agent.                                   |

Other components you **may** add and write to:

| `IComponentData`          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`NavDestination`** | Exists if the agent needs a destination. In this `struct`, there's a `float3` named `Destination` (relative to the world). There's also an optional `bool` named `Teleport`, which toggles teleportation to the provided `Destination`. Additionally, the `CustomLerp` property, if `true`, disables lerping by the navigation package so that it can be handled by user code (the `NavCustomLerping` component will exist on the agent if planning is done and custom lerping is required).             |
| **`NavFollow`**           | Exists if the agent is following an entity. One important property is the `Entity` `Target`, which is self-explanatory. There's also the `float` `MaxDistance`, which is the maximum distance before this agent will stop following the target entity. If `MaxDistance` is less than or equal to zero, this agent will follow the target entity no matter how far it is away. Finally, the `float` `MinDistance` is that which the agent maintains between itself and the target entity it follows. |
| **`NavStop`**             | Exists if the agent needs to stop moving (waits for jumping or falling to complete).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **`NavTerrainCapable`**   | Only needed if your agents must navigate on terrain. Don't use it otherwise, since it may negatively impact performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **`NavFlocking`**         | Exists if flocking behaviours should be applied to the agent.            |

### `NavSurface`

The `NavSurface` is much less complicated than the `NavAgent`. What you'll mainly be concerned with is its associated `NavSurfaceAuthoring` script. It has some important public variables:

| Variable                     | Type                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Default Value |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **`HasGameObjectTransform`** | `bool`                      | The GameObject's transform will be used and applied to possible children via [CopyTransformFromGameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/api/Unity.Transforms.CopyTransformFromGameObject.html?q=copytransform) if `true`, otherwise the entity's transform will be used and applied conversely via [CopyTransformToGameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/api/Unity.Transforms.CopyTransformToGameObject.html).                                                                               | `false`       |
| **`JumpableSurfaces`**       | `List<NavSurfaceAuthoring>` | A list of surfaces that are "jumpable" from *this* one. Automating what's "jumpable" is out of scope for this package, but automating jumping itself is not; thus, by using an agent-associated `parent.Value` and checking its `NavJumpableBufferElement` buffer, you can write code to deliberate on which surface to jump to. The [NavPointAndClickDestinationSystem](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Nav/Destination/NavPointAndClickDestinationSystem.cs) already does this for demonstrational purposes. | Empty         |
| **`Basis`**                  | `NavBasisAuthoring`         | The basis for a given surface. Surfaces parented to the same basis flock together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `null`        |

### `NavBasis`

Like the `NavSurface`, you only need to know about the related `NavBasisAuthoring` script. It has a couple public variables:

| Variable                           | Type                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Default Value |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **`HasGameObjectTransform`**       | `bool`                      | The GameObject's transform will be used and applied to possible children via [CopyTransformFromGameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/api/Unity.Transforms.CopyTransformFromGameObject.html?q=copytransform) if `true`, otherwise the entity's transform will be used and applied conversely via [CopyTransformToGameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/api/Unity.Transforms.CopyTransformToGameObject.html). | `false`       |
| **`ParentBasis`**                  | `NavBasisAuthoring`         | In essence, a basis can have a basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `null`        |

### **IMPORTANT:** Layers & You

By default, GameObjects with `NavSurface` components attached to them should be set to layer 28. All obstacles should be set to layer 29. Otherwise, things won't work because the navigation package depends on ray and collider casting. For more information on the layers and overriding them, see the section on settings below.

### Runtime Settings

The nav package has many settings you may override (at runtime), hence why the [NavSettingsOverrides](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Nav/NavSettingsOverrides.cs) class is included for your convenience in the demo code. This class makes it easy to retain your changes even when you update the nav package via UPM.

If you cloned or forked the monorepo, then you already have the class. Otherwise, feel free to copy-paste its code and modify it for your preferred overrides.

Now, what settings are there to override, anyway?

Settings corresponding to the layers are as follows:

| Setting             | Type  | Description              | Default Value |
|---------------------|-------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **`SurfaceLayer`**  | `int` | The layer for surfaces.  | `28`          |
| **`ObstacleLayer`** | `int` | The layer for obstacles. | `29`          |
| **`ColliderLayer`** | `int` | The layer for colliders. | `30`          |

And then there's the rest of the settings you may want to change:

| Setting                                    | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         | Default Value |
|--------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **`DestinationRateLimitSeconds`**          | `float` | Duration in seconds before a new destination will take effect after another. Prevents planning from being clogged with destinations which can then block interpolation of agents.                   | `0.8f`        |
| **`DestinationSurfaceColliderRadius`**     | `float` | A sphere collider of the specified radius is used to detect the destination surface.                                                                                                                | `1`           |
| **`JumpSecondsMax`**                       | `float` | Upper limit on the *duration* spent jumping before the agent is actually considered falling. This limit can be reached when the agent tries to jump too close to the edge of a surface and misses.  | `5`           |
| **`ObstacleRaycastDistanceMax`**           | `float` | Upper limit on the raycast distance when searching for an obstacle in front of a given NavAgent.                                                                                                    | `1000`        |
| **`SurfaceRaycastDistanceMax`**            | `float` | Upper limit on the raycast distance when searching for a surface below a given `NavAgent`.                                                                                                          | `1000`        |
| **`StoppingDistance`**                     | `float` | Stopping distance of an agent from its destination.                                                                                                                                                 | `1`           |
| **`PathSearchMax`**                        | `int`   | Upper limit on the search area size during path planning.                                                                                                                                           | `1000`        |
| **`IterationMax`**                         | `int`   | Upper limit on the iterations performed in a [NavMeshQuery](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Experimental.AI.NavMeshQuery.html) to find a path in the `NavPlanSystem`. | `1000`        |
| **`PathNodeMax`**                          | `int`   | Upper limit on a given path buffer. Exceeding this merely results in allocation of heap memory.                                                                                                     | `1000`        |
| **`SeparationWeight`**                     | `float` | The weight of separation in the flocking system. Pushes agents back once they get too close to another.                                                                                             | `2f`          |
| **`AlignmentWeight`**                      | `float` | The weight of alignment in the flocking system.                                                                                                                                                     | `1f`          |
| **`CohesionWeight`**                       | `float` | The weight of cohesion in the flocking system.                                                                                                                                                      | `1f`          |
| **`AgentCollisionAvoidanceStrength`**      | `float` | The strength of steering applied when agents steer away from each other.                                                                                                                            | `0.5f`        |
| **`ObstacleCollisionAvoidanceStrength`**   | `float` | The strength of steering applied when agents steer away from obstacles.                                                                                                                             | `5f`          |
| **`CollisionCastingAngle`**                | `float` | The (half) angle in which raycasts are being projected for the collision system. The direction is the entities forward vector.                                                                      | `65f`         |



### Compile-Time Constants

In addition to settings, there are also compile-time constants. You *can* change them directly in `NavConstants`, although that *usually* shouldn't be necessary. Plus, the constants will reset when you update via UPM.

| Constant                                   | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Default Value |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **`SURFACE_RAYCAST_MAX`**                  | `int`    | Upper limit on the number of raycasts to attempt in searching for a surface below the NavAgent. Exceeding this implies that there is no surface below the agent, its then determined to be falling which means that no more raycasts will be performed. | `100`         |
| **`JUMPABLE_SURFACE_MAX`**                 | `int`    | Upper limit on a given jumpable surface buffer. Exceeding this merely results in allocation of heap memory.                                                                                                                                             | `30`          |
| **`HUMANOID`**                             | `string` | The 'Humanoid' NavMesh agent type as a string.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `"Humanoid"`  |

## Tips

* Make sure you bake your `NavMeshSurfaces`!
* Anything with an authoring script on it also needs an accompanying [ConvertToEntity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/api/Unity.Entities.ConvertToEntity.html?q=convert%20to%20ent) script as well. Don't forget! The Unity Editor should warn you about that.
* The compatible version of [NavMeshComponents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents) is *already* in [Packages/com.reese.nav/ThirdParty](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/tree/master/Packages/com.reese.nav/ThirdParty/)! Use that and nothing else, and I mean for your entire project. Do not try to mix and match it with other versions.
* Upon spawning `NavAgents`, ensure you have their initial [Translation.Value](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/api/Unity.Transforms.Translation.html?q=translation) right, along with their `Offset`. Getting these things wrong may result in your agents being unable to raycast the surface below them, since they may be raycasting underneath it!
* Obstacles need [NavMeshObstacle](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/class-NavMeshObstacle.html) components, colliders, and the [ConvertToEntity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/api/Unity.Entities.ConvertToEntity.html?q=convert%20to%20ent) script on them. Otherwise obstacles will not be detected by raycasts.
* If you want to use the flocking system, you need to add the `NavFlocking` component to your agents.
