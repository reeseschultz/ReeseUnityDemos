# Contributing

You can contribute to this project by submitting:

1. [Pull requests](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/pulls) (PRs) for fixing bugs and adding features.
2. [Issues](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/issues/new/choose) for reporting bugs and suggesting features.

I, Reese, the owner of this project, prefer that you **submit PRs instead of issues**. Otherwise, you're entirely dependent on me. I offer no assurance that I will respond to you, fix bugs or add features on your behalf in a timely fashion, if ever. Well, unless you want to give me money. In that case, contact me at reeseblog@outlook.com and we can arrange prioritized support.

## What I Look for in [Pull Requests](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/pulls)

You do not need to file a separate issue to explain your PR—just explain what you're doing and why in the PR itself. I don't care to hear about how you're new to ECS, C#, programming, the planet Earth, etc. The only effective way to learn is by doing. Just submit the PR and I'll review your changes. If/when I find your changes acceptable, they'll be merged into the main branch. My evaluation of changes is not arbitrary, it's based on a number of [qualities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes), most importantly performance, maintainability and readability. As far as code style goes, no need for a guide—just write your code like the existing code.

### Navigation Package Changes

Changes to the navigation package in particular can be daunting. After making changes, ensuring the navigation-related demos continue to operate as expected is all you need to do (plus, rest assured I'll double-check your work). It is also recommended that you add demo scenes for testing and emphasizing new features.

## What I Look for in [Issues](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/issues/new/choose)

Follow the provided issue templates to the best of your ability. Generally speaking, I'm interested in observed and *reproducible* behavior, ideal or expected behavior, workarounds and thought-out solutions. If you treat the issue templates in bad faith, then the likelihood that I will collaborate with you approaches zero.
