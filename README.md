# ReeseUnityDemos

Unity demos emphasizing [DOTS](https://unity.com/dots)—ECS, jobs, and the Burst compiler—by me, Reese.

Here's how my articles on [reeseschultz.com](https://reeseschultz.com) relate to demos in this project:

## [DOTS Navigation with Auto-Jumping Agents and Movable Surfaces](https://reeseschultz.com/dots-navigation-with-auto-jumping-agents-and-movable-surfaces/)

The DOTS navigation scripts and demos are self-contained so you can use them in *your* project.

See the [user guide](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ReeseUnityDemos/blob/master/Packages/Nav/README.md)!
