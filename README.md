Unity packages and demos—emphasizing ECS, jobs and the Burst compiler—by me, Reese.

## Packages

This project is a [UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Packages.html) package [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that supports the included demos, featuring:

1. [Nav](https://openupm.com/packages/com.reese.nav/) - DOTS navigation with auto-jumping agents and movable surfaces.
2. [Spawning](https://openupm.com/packages/com.reese.spawning/) - Generic DOTS runtime spawning for any combination of prefab, components, and buffers (not compatible with [IL2CPP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html)).
3. [Randomization](https://openupm.com/packages/com.reese.random/) - `Unity.Mathematics.Random` number generators in jobs, including Burst-capable ones.

All of my packages are available on [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/). Please [support](https://www.patreon.com/openupm) it and its maintainer, Favo. We depend on dedicated people like him.

## Demos

Here's how my articles on [reeseschultz.com](https://reeseschultz.com) relate to samples in this project:

## IL2CPP

The demos use the [spawning package](https://openupm.com/packages/com.reese.spawning/), which isn't compatible with IL2CPP. Keep that in mind when building and running scenes.

## Linux & You

Linux users may need to do some extra work to get the project and/or packages up and running.

### Mono Setup

Install Mono by following [these directions](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).

### Burst Prerequisite Setup

Avoid sandboxing Unity Hub and Unity with Flatpak or Snap, otherwise `libdl.so` may be inaccessible to the editor.

Also, on Ubuntu, you may need to manually install `gcc-multilib` and `libncurses5` with:

```sh
sudo apt install gcc-multilib libncurses5
```

### IL2CPP Setup

If, despite prior warning, you still want to use IL2CPP, note that you need to install `clang` on Ubuntu via:

```sh
sudo apt install clang
```
