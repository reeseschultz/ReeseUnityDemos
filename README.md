## Demos

There are various demo scenes included in `Assets/Scenes`. Take a look!

## Linux & You

Linux users may need to do some extra work to get the project and/or packages up and running.

### Mono Setup

Install Mono by following [these directions](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).

### Burst Prerequisite Setup

Avoid sandboxing Unity Hub and Unity with Flatpak or Snap, otherwise `libdl.so` may be inaccessible to the editor.

Also, on Ubuntu, you may need to manually install `gcc-multilib` and `libncurses5` with:

```sh
sudo apt install gcc-multilib libncurses5
```

### IL2CPP Setup

Note that you may need to install `clang` on Ubuntu via:

```sh
sudo apt install clang
```
