Unity packages and demos—emphasizing ECS, jobs and the Burst compiler—by me, Reese.

## Packages

This project is a [UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Packages.html) package [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that supports the included demos, featuring:

1. [Nav](https://openupm.com/packages/com.reese.nav/) - DOTS navigation with auto-jumping agents and movable surfaces; released as a package on the `nav` branch.
2. [Randomization](https://openupm.com/packages/com.reese.random/) - `Unity.Mathematics.Random` number generators in jobs, including Burst-capable ones; released as a package on the `random` branch.

Other packages are currently under development, such as the spatial event system, and are temporarily being used as demo code until they're ready to be released.

## Demos

There are various demo scenes included in `Assets/Scenes`. Take a look!

## Linux & You

Linux users may need to do some extra work to get the project and/or packages up and running.

### Mono Setup

Install Mono by following [these directions](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).

### Burst Prerequisite Setup

Avoid sandboxing Unity Hub and Unity with Flatpak or Snap, otherwise `libdl.so` may be inaccessible to the editor.

Also, on Ubuntu, you may need to manually install `gcc-multilib` and `libncurses5` with:

```sh
sudo apt install gcc-multilib libncurses5
```

### IL2CPP Setup

Note that you may need to install `clang` on Ubuntu via:

```sh
sudo apt install clang
```
