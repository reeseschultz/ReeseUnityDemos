# ReeseUnityDemos

Unity packages and demos—emphasizing ECS, jobs, and the Burst compiler—by me, Reese.

## Packages

This project is a [UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Packages.html) package [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that supports the included demos, featuring:

1. [Nav](https://openupm.com/packages/com.reese.nav/) - DOTS navigation with auto-jumping agents and movable surfaces.
2. [Spawning](https://openupm.com/packages/com.reese.spawning/) - Generic DOTS runtime spawning for any combination of prefab, components, and buffers.
3. [Randomization](https://openupm.com/packages/com.reese.random/) - `Unity.Mathematics.Random` number generators in jobs, including Burst-capable ones.

All of my packages are available on [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/). Please [support](https://www.patreon.com/openupm) it and its maintainer, Favo. We depend on dedicated people like him.

### `ubump`

My packages benefit from [ubump](https://github.com/reeseschultz/ubump), automating their SemVer-bumping needs, including committing, pushing, tagging, changelog generation and subtree splitting so each package can be released stand-alone and imported with OpenUPM or Git.

## Demos

Here's how my articles on [reeseschultz.com](https://reeseschultz.com) relate to samples in this project:

### [DOTS Navigation with Auto-Jumping Agents and Movable Surfaces](https://reeseschultz.com/dots-navigation-with-auto-jumping-agents-and-movable-surfaces/)

The DOTS navigation scripts and demos are self-contained so you can use them in *your* project.

## Linux & You

Linux users may need to do some extra work to get the project and/or packages up and running.

### Mono Setup

Install Mono by following [these directions](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).

### Burst Prerequisite Setup

On Ubuntu I couldn't use the [Burst compiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.2/manual/index.html) until I manually installed `gcc-multilib` and `libncurses5` with:

```sh
sudo apt install gcc-multilib libncurses5
```

You may have these libraries already, or you could be experiencing a different problem. Be sure to read any error messages the Unity Editor outputs.
